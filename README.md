# Oomph-Public Health and Wellness App.

Oomph is an app that helps patients with orthopedic problems stick to their rehabilitative exercise regime, and track their progress

# API keys and authentication.

For security reasons, authentication details for hosting on Firebase and API keys for running authentication from Firebase on the APP have been removed.
.firebase/hostingfirebaseWlkS.cache ( auth details )
src/firebase/config.js ( API keys )

To run this app you will need to have a Firebase account and set up the hosting and authentication from there.
Firebase will provide the necessary keys and auth details.

## Features
* User login and authentication using Firebase
* Pose detection with TensorFlow JS
* Angle calculation and detection for Lateral Arm Raise exercise
* Calculate repetition of the exercise
* Badge feature that counts the number of exercise sessions and repetitions

## Demo
Here is a demo of the app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rZ7OXfNq6g

## Technologies
* JavaScript
* TensorFlow JS
* MongoDB
* Mongo Compass
* React
* Material UI
* Firebase

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
